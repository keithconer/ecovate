LOG REPORT 4



To be honest we had a short meeting with the group and we havent figure out yet what our color palette will be.. So what we pass on the school activity was rush and base on impulsive thoughts only.

But when i went home, i tried to look for some inspiration, think of the purpose of the website/organization, then conceptualize several drafts for logo until i finalized one. After finalizing it i conclude that our website looks better and more suitable to the green theme palette

Then after i discuss with the theme the color palette, we began to plan what should be prioritize first and what is the purpose of our website.
Since we have eco bottles and flowers product.. I came up with the plan of making a website that promotes eco friendly products such as tumblers that are wooden, phone cases that are recyled materials, and lastly since we have a flower brand before. We decided to make it the turning point of our website, since our prof agreed that we can add new products so we decided to add the plants. Specifically plants that boost the oxygen.

Eco friendly plus Innovate equals to ecovate. So thats where we come up the group name..


In terms of designing we had a google meet and then i ask them to atleast draw the wireframe at the paint like quick sketch then i consider if it is feasibile or not. 
I asked them to do the designing and ill finalize/implement which are possible to achieve within time period. Also because some of us have unstable internet connection which can possibly cause some issues in the live share coding session so i decided to take the whole responsibility for the development/coding part. But every after implementations. I send them screenshots of my progress, if i implement a new features and stuff so that they are still updated with the group's progress.

After designing, i began now implementing the javascripts/backend so that our components that require methods/scripts will now work. I find this task light task because i have a AI with me that helps me with the syntax regarding parameters that i need..


Then after i finished the whole website..
I began now the integration testing phase, wherein i check if everything is working accordingly to the plan. Which of the components require adjustments, which of it didn't pass, which of it still needs improvement. Then after i finished the integration testing phase.. 
Luckily all of it pass and then thats concludes it all.


After integration testing phase, i finalize this log report and then added some of progress here, the stuff that i need also the journey in building it.
